# Chamberless
Antichamber inspired puzzle game. Unity Version.

Thanks to the unstoppable force that is Plot, the interdimensional hypercube at the heart of the universe has been shattered, leaving the realms of the abyss in a state of disarray with its shards. Each shard causes a different effect on the fabric of reality, ones that seem to bend both time and space. To restore balance, you must travel to each of the four realms and return the shards by overcoming the effect each one has on its realm.
